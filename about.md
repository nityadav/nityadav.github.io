I am a Software Developer by profession. I work on problems ranging from backend design to
employing neural networks to solve language understanding problems. I am passionate about
Cricket. As and when I find time, I try to build insights using Cricket data. I also love
travelling, especially visiting places not inhabited by too many humans. The background
image that you see is one such place in Dinosaur National Monument National Park.
